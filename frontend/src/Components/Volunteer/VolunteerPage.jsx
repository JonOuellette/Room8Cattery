            <p>Do you have a passion for helping animals? Do you love cats? Room 8 would love to have you volunteer! A variety of opportunities are waiting for you and the end result is helping the cats and getting them ready to be adopted into new, loving, permanent homes.</p>
            <p>â€‹Do you have a few hours on a Saturday morning (or two) each month to donate your time helping clean the cattery at Room 8? We have a few volunteers, but could really use more. Not necessarily fun stuff -- cleaning/sanitizing litter boxes, sweeping catios and rooms, wiping down cat furniture and shelves, cleaning kitten cages (well, actually that is fun), doing laundry and maybe washing a few dishes. Not hard labor :) and -- BONUS! -- you get to talk to and pet cats while you work! If you are interested please complete the volunteer form.</p>
