# Cat Rescue and Cattery Project Proposal

## Tech Stack
For the Cat Rescue and Cattery project, I will be utilizing **React** for the front end, **Flask** for the back end, and **PostgreSQL** for database management. This tech stack will support a dynamic and interactive web application capable of handling real-time data updates and user interactions. External APIs such as **Stripe** for donations and **Google Sheets** for data management will be integrated to enhance the application's functionality.

## Project Focus
The focus of the Cat Rescue and Cattery project is to create a full-stack application that balances between an engaging and intuitive front-end UI and robust back-end server logic. The front end aims to provide users with an easy-to-navigate platform for adopting cats, submitting volunteer forms, viewing cat details, and making donations. The back end will manage data, integrate external APIs, and provide role-based actions for different user types (fosters and admins).

## Platform Type
The project will be developed as a web application, with a possible future of it being built into a phone app as well. The choice of the web application, however, ensures broad accessibility for users across different devices and platforms without needing to download additional software.

## Project Goal
The goal of the Cat Rescue and Cattery project is to support the non-profit cattery by providing a means for the public to view cats available for adoption, learn about the organization, donate, and provide a method for those interested in volunteering to reach out. It also allows those that are part of the organization to better organize and keep track of the data/information that the cattery has to deal with every day.

## Target Users
The platform targets a wide audience, including cat enthusiasts, potential adopters, volunteers, and the cattery staff. The intuitive design ensures that users of varying technological skills can navigate the site effectively, whether they're browsing available cats, looking to contribute, or managing the cattery's operations.

## Data Usage and Collection
The web app will collect data through user submissions (adoptions, volunteer forms, donations) and manage cat information entered by fosters and admins. We will ensure data integrity and privacy through validation checks and secure data handling practices. Admins will have access to Google Sheets integration for an organized view of cat and volunteer information directly extracted from the database.

## Project Approach

### Database Schema
The database will include tables for Users, Cats, Adoptions, Volunteers, and Donations. There will be clear relationships between these entities to allow efficient data retrieval and updates.

### API Challenges
We will integrate Stripe for payment processing and Google Sheets for data management while handling potential API constraints like rate limiting and data format differences. Our custom back-end API will deal with user authentication, data integrity, and support for large volumes of submissions.

### Security
The application will implement secure authentication, data encryption, and role-based access controls to protect sensitive information and ensure that users can only perform actions aligned with their roles.

### Functionality
Features will include user registration/login, cat adoption listings, volunteer sign-up forms, donation processing, and detailed views for each cat. Fosters will manage cats they are fostering, while admins will have comprehensive control over users and cat records.

### User Flow
The web application will guide users from the landing page to different sections based on their interests: adopting a cat, learning about the rescue, volunteering, or making a donation. For logged-in users, the navigation will adapt based on their role, leading fosters and admins through their respective actions and dashboard views.

### Stretch Goals and Features
Potential future enhancements include real-time notifications for new cats available for adoption, a forum for community discussion, interactive educational content about cat care and rescue operations, and a comprehensive admin dashboard with analytics and reports.
